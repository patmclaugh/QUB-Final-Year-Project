# Autonomous Robot Navigation System
**Final Year Project | BEng Software & Electronic Systems Engineering | Queen's University Belfast**

## What I Built
Custom navigation software (C++) for a TurtleBot3 mobile robot that tripled navigation success rate from 20% to 60% through algorithm optimization and systematic testing.

## Key Achievement
**3x Performance Improvement**: Improved autonomous navigation success from baseline 20% to 60% through:
- Developing custom C++ navigation algorithm (NID-DWB controller)
- Tuning parameters through Gazebo simulation
- Hardware testing and iterative problem-solving
- Root cause analysis of hardware/software integration issues

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++ (primary), Python (analysis scripts)
- **Framework**: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)
- **Platforms**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04), VirtualBox, Gazebo simulator
- **Hardware**: TurtleBot3 Burger with Raspberry Pi 4, LiDAR sensor
- **Tools**: Git, SSH, Nav2 navigation stack

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
✓ C++ software development for embedded systems  
✓ Algorithm design and optimization  
✓ Linux system administration and configuration  
✓ Hardware/software integration and debugging  
✓ Systematic testing methodology  
✓ Technical documentation and presentation  

## Results
- **Success Rate**: 60% (vs 20% baseline) in hardware trials
- **Path Quality**: Smoother trajectories, larger obstacle clearances
- **Reliability**: Eliminated oscillation issues from standard controller

## Project Details
This project implements a Near-Identity Diffeomorphism (NID) coordinate transform to map high-level navigation commands into kinematically feasible robot controls, balancing speed with provable safety on resource-constrained hardware.
